# Personal Site 2.0 

The second iteration of my personal website. Still a work in progress and will be making some more additions over time. Want to use it yourself? Feel free to fork or clone the project with attribution! :rocket:

## Latest Changes 10/01/2021
Currently working on a refactor of a lot of the components to make things more reusable and to allow users to input data should they wish to use this website as a template.
